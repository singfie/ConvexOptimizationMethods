# ConvexOptimizationMethods
A Collection of implemented methods for convex optimization in Python. 
These scripts were initially created to learn Convex Optimization methods and their implementation. 

Convex Optimization algorithms are powerful instruments to find optimal solutions to problems with a well defined mathematical
structure and are often used in environments that require solving problems with a large complexity.
